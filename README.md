The 'Web Development with No-SQL' course project involved creating this basic flower shop website.

I decided to create a unique flower boutique website as a means of expressing my love for flowers. Through this website, I aim to showcase a wide range of flower categories and introduce customers to varieties they may not have encountered before. 
By doing so, I hope to create a visually captivating and memorable experience for visitors, while also encouraging them to explore the beauty of lesser-known blooms.
